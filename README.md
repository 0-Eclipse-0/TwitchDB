# TwitchDB

The codebase for [TwitchDB](http://www.twitchdb.tv/)

Bugs. Memoryleaks. Whateva.

If you know what you're doing, feel free to do stuff.

Dev Enviroment Requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/)

Once installed, and you've added a Twitch app to your Twitch account, configure config.js.

In the directory you've cloned TwitchDB in to run:

`npm install`

Then to run TwitchDB in a Dev Enviroment run:

`node app dev`

If successful, you should see something similar to "listening on localhost:8080".
